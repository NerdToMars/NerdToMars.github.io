# A Simple Image Synthesis Pipeline for Machine Learning Model Training

This project demonstrates a simple image synthesis pipeline based on Mitsuba3 and visualization tooling using Rerun. The pipeline generates synthetic images for machine learning model training with comprehensive visualization capabilities.

## Overview

The pipeline combines the power of Mitsuba3 for physically-based rendering with Rerun's advanced visualization tools to create high-quality synthetic datasets for machine learning applications.

## Key Features

- **Physically-based rendering** using Mitsuba3
- **Interactive 3D scene exploration** with Rerun
