My experiences in industries will also help to bring more practical applications for urban mobility systems.\nAutonomous Manipulating System The focus of my attention in this project is developing an automatic manipulating system based on stereo vision. Firstly, I established an arm-robot hardware platform. Secondly, I adopted a decision model based on reinforcement-learning to handle workpieces effectively. This project has two stages. The first is to build a precision robot platform and provide adequate controlling interface second to adopt approaches that manipulate items based on its characteristics such as population and volume.\nIn this project, an automated robot platform was established successfully because of my solid understanding of control theories and well-built engineering skills.\nSmart 3D Machine Vision Intelligent urban mobility systems require smart machine vision. Machine vision or imaging is a complicated problem. During my MEng\u0026rsquo;s studies, I established the research topic of optical imaging based on deep learning in my group. I introduced a multifunctional imaging scheme based on deep learning methods. Based on this scheme, I have developed several deep learning inspection systems for our current industrial partner such as HP. Considering my automation background, I will be interested in utilizing these smart machine vision techniques to integrate information on human-machine and commercial activities.\nIn this IRG, I will exploit advanced control theories and efficient signal processing techniques to develop next-generation urban mobility systems. I am confident that I will develop a valuable mobility system to enhance sustainability and societal well-being on a global scale.\n","date":1545235200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1545235200,"objectID":"05d6a04187edef0ef3cf7d5c2dacb1db","permalink":"/rs/autonomy/","publishdate":"2018-12-20T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/rs/autonomy/","section":"rs","summary":"Autonomy Engineering I am an electrical engineer who had got the A-level appraisal in Huawei; I enjoy programming and developing an automatic control system.

Firstly, the Transport Intensity of Equation is applied to obtain the 3D profile of the sample in nanoscale. Secondly, the deconvolution-based (PSF image model) algorithm is applied to extract the depth in the obtained image stack. This project has two stages. The first is to prove the validity of my methods via simulation and the second to implement a fine-tuned optical system based on proved methods.\nIn this project, a hyper-domains imaging system was built successfully because of my solid knowledge of optics and well-built experimental skills.\nImaging System based on Deep Learning During my MEng\u0026rsquo;s studies, I established the research topic of optical imaging based on deep learning in my group.
