      <description>Autonomy Engineering I am an electrical engineer who had got the A-level appraisal in Huawei; I enjoy programming and developing an automatic control system. I became interested in the autonomy for Mobility-on-Demand because of the enthusiasm of building an intelligent world. During my BEng&amp;rsquo;s studies, automation, my major not only equipped me with the knowledge but also encouraging me to take more works in the high-level automatic control system.</description>

      <description>Bio-Vision Research I am an optical researcher; I enjoy optics and developing micro/nanoscale imaging system. I became interested in Quantitative Phase Microscopy (QPM) because of the beauty in the nanoscale world. QPM and phase retrieval methods have fascinated my current research group for more than a decade and me for several years. In microscopy experiments, the phase part of a light wave often contains valuable information on the studied specimen.</description>
